他人的平凡是我捉不到的夢
怎麼有人能不沉浸悲傷 直至寂寥
是因為擁有了嚮往
還是選擇的被遺忘
那些踏著蹣跚的繁華者 面帶微笑
是否是尋到了歸處
妳是否願成就我途
成為渺小的我逡巡著的金烏
我如何才能無所嚮往的活著

The ordinary of others is a dream I can't catch
How can someone not be immersed in sadness until loneliness
because of longing
Or choose to be forgotten
The prosperous people who are stumbling on their faces are smiling
Did you find a home
Are you willing to accomplish my path
Become the golden crow that I patrol
How can I live without desire

用盡人間淚，換一天上笑顏
沉醉夢裡那無人懂的幻
作曲贈佳人，那好似月牙眼
雖知應是那皓月降凡間

Use up the tears of the world, and change the smile on the day
Indulge in the illusion that no one understands in the dream
Compose a song for a beautiful woman, it's like a crescent moon
Although I know it should be that bright moon descending into the mortal world

眸月令人迷，燦爛使我折煞
星月頃刻間就失去風華
雖身處花間，笑靨花亦驚詫
熟能在舉手間舞起繁花

The moon in the eyes is fascinating, the brilliance makes me shattered
The moon and stars lose their splendor in an instant
Even though I am among the flowers, the smiling flowers are also surprised
Familiarity dances with raised hands

從未感受過擁有心的我 那麼深沉
如心曝曬烈陽之下
燃盡做塵滋養蒹葭
光將倩影刻在我的心上 思君暮晨
誰能理解魂牽夢縈
目盡皆君耳猶幻聽
他人稱的平凡我捉不到的夢
夜半將思念捲成煙化作輕風

I've never felt that I have a heart so deep
Like being exposed to the scorching sun
Burn up to make dust to nourish the jianjia
Light engraved the shadow on my heart Sijun Muchen
Who can understand the soul
All eyes and ears are still hallucinations
What others call ordinary dreams I can't catch
In the middle of the night, the thoughts are rolled into smoke and turned into a breeze

無人要的我，可曾能令君笑
我眼中林間起舞的花蝶
分隔你我的，陰雨終日繚繞
獨自用烏雲構築的世界

No one wants me, can I ever make you laugh
Butterfly dancing in the forest in my eyes
Separating you and me, the rain is lingering all day long
A world built with dark clouds alone

逐君遙途殊，合掌散盡流沙
君貌似皓月掛那夜如漆
將別無復期，只遙望風亂髮
願君聞此曲湧漫漫回憶

Chasing you are far away, put your palms together to disperse the quicksand
Jun looks like the bright moon hangs like lacquer that night
There will be no relapse, just looking at the wind
May you hear this song and have long memories
